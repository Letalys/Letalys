# :construction: My Github Profile and Repos currently on Rework :construction:

Don't be scared ! :scream:

This overhaul of my different repositories is necessary to better manage projects, new features, documentation and improve issue management and thus promote collaboration. :handshake:

The old codes will be republished little by little depending on the projects, the names may also be revised. 

- ConvertFrom-Robocoplog
- Powershell PasswordGenerator
- Powershell SCCM CustomInventories
- Powershell ADQueries Collection
- Install RSAT
- NetAdapter Import/Export
...

Please feel free to contact me if you need a particular code that was previously on my Repo ! :nerd_face::nerd_face:

# Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Christophe Goemaere**, also known as **Letalys**.

## ðŸ˜„ About me
I'm an **IT Expert** in the **Digital Workplace** domain, working closely with **Windows environments** and **end-user** technologies, especially **Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM)**. I also have experience with **Windows infrastructure**, particularly **Active Directory**.
Originally trained as a .NET developer, I fell in love with PowerShell a few years ago, which makes it my current favorite technology.

## âœ¨ What I do
I love sharing my ideas and projects related to **PowerShell** or whatever sparks my creativity at the moment. Whether it's small to medium projects or just useful **code snippets (gists)**, I hope others will find them helpful. I am always looking to grow through the interactions and collaborations that my work can bring, as I believe in learning and evolving through shared knowledge.

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- **ConvertFrom-RobocopLog**: A PowerShell parser for Robocopy log files.
- **Custom WMI Inventory Templates for MECM**: PowerShell templates for generating custom WMI inventories in Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.
- **Complete Password Generator**: A robust PowerShell script for generating secure passwords.

## ðŸ‘¯ Let's collaborate
Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute, or even start a conversation. I'm always open to **new ideas** and love to be inspired by other creators. Together, we can push the boundaries of what's possible with PowerShell and beyond.

ðŸ’¬ And remember:
> **Keep Calm and PowerShell !!**
